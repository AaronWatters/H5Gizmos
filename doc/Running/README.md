This document describes how to statically configure a Gizmo,
how to start the primary component of a Gizmo,
and how to interact with the Gizmo components while they are running.
Interactions with a Gizmo can be divided into configurations which
may or must be specified before the primary component begins to run
and dynamic interactions with a running component.
