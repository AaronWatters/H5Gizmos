# H5Gizmos

H5Gizmos provides
tools for building interactive graphical interfaces for applications using browser technology and HTML5. 

A Gizmo "child" interface displays in a standard web browser such as Chrome and communicates
with a "parent" Python process using a web socket and other HTTP protocols.  H5Gizmos can load and
use arbitrary Javascript resources to provide sophisticated interactive graphical interfaces.

The H5Gizmo mechanism is designed to facilitate the development of "dashboards" and special purpose
tools for scientific and technical workflows.

The animation below shows a gizmo script displaying a matplotlib plot running from the VS code editor.
The gizmo user interface appears as a new HTML frame in the browser instance below the editor.
